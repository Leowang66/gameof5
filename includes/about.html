    	Noun  -  / game-of-5 /</p>
    	<p>A play on the education term <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification_of_learning' target='_blank'>gamify</a>. To gamify is to introduce elements of game play into learning to increase student engagement. Gameof5 helps teachers organize, structure, and most importantly gamify their courses.</p>

      <p>Gameof5 began as a system to structure and present course material, as well as track what was happening in my classroom. Gamification evolved with student expectations to 'earn as they learn'. In other words students wanted to <i>level up</i>, much like they would in a video game or social media. I have had a lot of fun building gameof5 and sharing it with my students. I hope you can level up your lessons using gameof5.</p>
